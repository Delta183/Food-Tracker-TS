# Food-Tracker-TS
Typescript version of a previous repository. A Food tracker website with the means to save meals as a user and share it with other users. Provides comprehensive statistics about the meals and their selections.
It should be noted that despite hashing and user security being taken into account, this is not to be officially released and I advise that you do not enter important information into this website.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- TypeScript/TSX
- CSS

## Notes:
- Implementing the cache on the backend would be possible yet the MongoDB implementation proves to be a challenge with respect to MongoDB documentation and schemas.
- Additionally, the use of SSL to obfuscate the emails of the users on the network calls would be paramount to user security yet not something I can implement reasonably given the scope of this project.
- With hindsight, the purposes and data used in this project may not have been conducive to the non-relational database that is MongoDB but it nevertheless served as a learning opportunity.
